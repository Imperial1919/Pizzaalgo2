1. Call man on Phone.
2. Decide on the pizza you would like to order.



3. Observe menu if needed right before the man picks up.
Place order, pay with card via voice identification.
4. Wait for pizza.
5. Retreive pizza, tip optional.. Nah. jk, don't be like that. :p




IF THEY GET ORDER INCORRECT:
6. Demand refund and throw it in the pizzaman's manager's face... eeeehh, you ghtought i would just throw it in the poor guy's face? 
A UTTERLY sane course of action that of which, would not get Me arrested with assault.
